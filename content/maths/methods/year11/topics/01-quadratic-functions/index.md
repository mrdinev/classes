## Lesson Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Subject** | Year 11 Mathematical Methods |
| **Topic** | Quadratic Functions |
| **Duration** | 60 minutes |
| **Framework** | VTLM 2.0 / Heathmont Model |

## Learning Intentions

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Identify the key features of a quadratic function including vertex, axis of symmetry, and x-intercepts
- Sketch the graph of a quadratic function in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
- Interpret the effect of changing parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ on the shape and position of the parabola

## Success Criteria

Students can demonstrate success by:

- Correctly identifying the vertex and axis of symmetry from a quadratic equation
- Accurately sketching at least two quadratic functions with correct key features labelled
- Explaining in their own words how the value of $a$ affects the parabola

## Lesson Structure

### 🌉 Bridge (10 minutes)
*VTLM 2.0: Enabling Learning — activating prior knowledge*

**Purpose:** Connect new content to students' existing knowledge of linear functions and basic algebra.

**Activity: Think-Pair-Share**

Display on board:
> "What do you already know about parabolas? Where have you seen them in real life?"

- 2 minutes individual thinking
- 2 minutes pair discussion
- 4 minutes class share — record responses on board
- Teacher connects responses to today's learning intention

**Check for understanding:** Ask students to sketch a rough parabola shape on their mini whiteboards. Look for common misconceptions about orientation and symmetry.

**Resources needed:** Mini whiteboards, markers

### 🔍 Discover (15 minutes)
*VTLM 2.0: Explicit Teaching — I do, We do*

**Purpose:** Direct instruction on key features of quadratic functions with worked examples.

**Sequence:**

1. **I Do (8 min)** — Teacher models on board:
   - Introduce $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ and name each parameter
   - Work through Example 1: sketch $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3$
     - Find y-intercept: let $x = 0$, so $y = 3$
     - Find x-intercepts: solve $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$, giving $x = 1$ and $x = 3$
     - Find vertex: axis of symmetry $x = \frac{-(−4)}{2(1)} = 2$, vertex at $(2, -1)$
     - Sketch with all features labelled

2. **We Do (7 min)** — Students work alongside teacher:
   - Teacher works Example 2: $f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 8$ on board
   - Students complete same steps in their books simultaneously
   - Pause and check after each step

**Key vocabulary to emphasise:** parabola, vertex, axis of symmetry, x-intercept, y-intercept, concave up/down

### ✏️ Achieve (25 minutes)
*VTLM 2.0: Supported Application — guided then independent practice*

**Purpose:** Students apply learning with decreasing levels of support.

**Guided Practice (10 min):**

Students work in pairs on Questions 1–3 of the worksheet. Teacher circulates, targeting common errors:
- Sign errors when finding the axis of symmetry
- Forgetting to check concavity (sign of $a$)
- Incomplete labelling on sketches

**Independent Practice (15 min):**

Students work individually on Questions 4–6 of the worksheet.

Teacher circulates and uses targeted questioning:
- *"How do you know which way the parabola opens?"*
- *"What does the y-intercept tell you before you do any calculation?"*
- *"Can you check your x-intercepts are correct by substituting back in?"*

**Differentiation:**
- **Support:** Provide partially completed worked example scaffold
- **Extension:** Questions 7–8 — transformations of $f(x) = x^2$, introducing vertex form

### 🪞 Reflect (10 minutes)
*VTLM 2.0: Enabling Learning — consolidating and metacognition*

**Exit Ticket (5 min):**

Students answer on a slip of paper before leaving:

> 1. State the axis of symmetry of $f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 1$
> 2. One thing I understood well today was...
> 3. One thing I am still unsure about is...

**Class discussion (5 min):**
- Return to learning intentions — thumbs up/sideways/down check
- Preview next lesson: solving quadratics using the quadratic formula

**Teacher action:** Review exit tickets before next lesson to identify students needing additional support.

## Teacher Notes

**Common misconceptions to address:**
- Students often confuse the axis of symmetry formula — emphasise it comes from $x = \frac{-b}{2a}$, not $\frac{b}{2a}$
- When $a < 0$, students may still draw a concave up parabola out of habit
- Students sometimes find x-intercepts and stop, forgetting the vertex

**Timing notes:**
- If the Bridge runs long, trim guided practice to 7 minutes
- Exit tickets are essential — do not skip even if time is short, reduce to just Question 1

**Next lesson:** Quadratic formula and the discriminant
