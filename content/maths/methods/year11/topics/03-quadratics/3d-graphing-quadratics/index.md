{{% notice style="learning" title="🎯 Learning Intentions" %}}
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify key features of $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$: vertex, axis of symmetry, x-intercepts and y-intercept
- Sketch the graph of a quadratic function with all key features labelled
- Interpret the effect of changing parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ on the parabola
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice style="success" title="✅ Success Criteria" %}}
Students demonstrate success by:
- Correctly identifying vertex and axis of symmetry $x = \dfrac{-b}{2a}$ from a given equation
- Accurately sketching at least two quadratic functions with full labelling
- Explaining in their own words how the sign of $a$ affects the parabola's shape

## 🌉 Bridge — Detail (10 minutes)

{{% notice style="bridge" title="Prompt displayed on board" %}}
*"What do you already know about parabolas? Where have you seen them in real life?"*
{{% /notice %}}

| Step | Time | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Think | 2 min | Students reflect individually |
| Pair | 2 min | Discuss with a partner |
| Share | 4 min | Class discussion — record responses on board |
| Connect | 2 min | Teacher links responses to learning intention |

**Check for understanding:** Students sketch a rough parabola on mini whiteboards. Look for misconceptions about symmetry and orientation.

**Resources needed:** Mini whiteboards, markers

## 🔍 Discover — Detail (15 minutes)

{{% notice style="discover" title="I Do (8 min) — Example 1: Sketch f(x) = x² - 4x + 3" %}}

| Step | Working |
|---|---|
| y-intercept | $f(0) = 3 \Rightarrow (0,\, 3)$ |
| x-intercepts | $(x-1)(x-3) = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1$ or $x = 3$ |
| Axis of symmetry | $x = \dfrac{-(-4)}{2(1)} = 2$ |
| Vertex | $f(2) = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1 \Rightarrow (2,\,-1)$ |
| Concavity | $a = 1 > 0 \Rightarrow$ concave up ∪ |

**We Do (7 min):** Students work alongside teacher on $f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 8$

**Key vocabulary:** parabola, vertex, axis of symmetry, x-intercept, y-intercept, concave up/down

**Interactive tool:** [Geogebra Parabola Explorer](https://www.geogebra.org/graphing)

## ✏️ Achieve — Detail (25 minutes)

{{% notice style="achieve" title="Guided Practice (10 min) — Q1–3 in pairs" %}}
Common errors to watch for:

| Error | What to look for |
|---|---|
| Sign error | Students use $\dfrac{b}{2a}$ instead of $\dfrac{-b}{2a}$ |
| Concavity | Students draw concave up even when $a < 0$ |
| Incomplete sketch | Missing labels on key features |
{{% /notice %}}

**Independent Practice (15 min) — Q4–6 individually**

Targeted questioning while circulating:
- *"How do you know which way the parabola opens?"*
- *"What does the y-intercept tell you before you do any calculation?"*
- *"Can you check your x-intercepts by substituting back in?"*

|---|---|
| **Support** | Partially completed worked example scaffold |
| **Extension** | Q7–8: transformations of $f(x) = x^2$, introducing vertex form |

## 🪞 Reflect — Detail (10 minutes)

{{% notice style="reflect" title="🪞 Exit Ticket (5 min)" %}}
1. State the axis of symmetry of $f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 1$
2. One thing I understood well today was...
3. One thing I am still unsure about is...
{{% /notice %}}

**Class Discussion (5 min):**
- Thumbs up/sideways/down check against learning intentions
- Preview next lesson: the quadratic formula $x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

**Teacher action:** Review exit tickets before next lesson to identify students needing additional support.

{{% notice style="warning" title="⚠️ Teacher Notes" %}}
| | |
|---|---|
| **Misconceptions** | Axis of symmetry sign error; drawing concave up when $a < 0$; stopping after x-intercepts without finding vertex |
| **Timing** | If Bridge runs long, trim guided practice to 7 min. Do not skip exit ticket — reduce to Q1 only if needed |
| **Next lesson** | Quadratic formula and the discriminant |
