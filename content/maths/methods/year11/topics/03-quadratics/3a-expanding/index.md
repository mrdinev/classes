{{% notice style="learning" title="🎯 Learning Intention" %}}
We are learning to expand brackets and collect like terms in algebraic expressions, including single brackets, double brackets (binomial products), perfect squares, and differences of two squares.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice style="success" title="✅ Success Criteria" %}}
1. I can expand a single bracket expression using the distributive law: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
2. I can expand double brackets using the FOIL method
3. I can collect like terms after expanding
4. I can expand and simplify multi-bracket expressions

## 🌉 Bridge — Detail (5 minutes)

{{% notice style="bridge" title="Do Now — displayed on board" %}}
Simplify these expressions — what are the like terms?

1. $3x + 5x$
2. $4x^2 - x^2 + 2x$
3. $2x + 3 - x + 7$
4. $5x - 2y + 3x + y$
{{% /notice %}}

Students work individually for 2–3 minutes, then quick whole-class check.

**Quick recall prompt:** *"What does it mean to expand $3(x + 2)$?"* *(Answer: multiply every term inside the brackets by 3)*

**Check for understanding:** Watch for students who confuse terms with different powers — e.g. treating $3x$ and $3x^2$ as like terms.

## 🔍 Discover — Detail (25 minutes)

### Part 1 — Algebraic Terms and Single Brackets

{{% notice style="discover" title="Key idea: Distributive Law" %}}
$$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$

- $2(x - 4) = 2x - 8$
- $-3(4 - 2x) = -12 + 6x$ *(note sign care with negative factors)*
{{% /notice %}}

**I Do (5 min):** Simplify $2(x - 5) - 3(x + 5)$

| Step | Working |
|---|---|
| Expand each bracket | $2(x-5) = 2x - 10$ and $-3(x+5) = -3x - 15$ |
| Write together | $2x - 10 - 3x - 15$ |
| Collect like terms | $= -x - 25$ |

**We Do:** Students attempt independently, then solutions revealed:
- a) $4(2x - 3) - 2(x + 4) = 6x - 20$
- b) $3x(x - 2) - 2(x + 1) = 3x^2 - 8x - 2$

---

### Part 2 — Double Brackets (Binomial Products)

{{% notice style="discover" title="Key idea: FOIL Method" %}}
$(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd$

**F**irst · **O**uter · **I**nner · **L**ast

Example: $(x + 3)(x - 4) = x^2 - 4x + 3x - 12 = x^2 - x - 12$
{{% /notice %}}

**I Do (5 min):** Expand and simplify $(3x - 7)(2x + 4)$

| FOIL | Working |
|---|---|
| **F**irst | $3x \times 2x = 6x^2$ |
| **O**uter | $3x \times 4 = 12x$ |
| **I**nner | $-7 \times 2x = -14x$ |
| **L**ast | $-7 \times 4 = -28$ |
| Collect | $6x^2 + 12x - 14x - 28 = 6x^2 - 2x - 28$ |

**We Do:** Students attempt independently, then solutions revealed:
- a) $(x - 10)(x - 12) = x^2 - 22x + 120$
- b) $(4x - 5)(2x - 3) = 8x^2 - 22x + 15$

---

### Part 3 — Special Expansions (5 min)

{{% notice style="discover" title="Two useful identities" %}}
**Perfect square:** $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
- Example: $(x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16$

**Difference of two squares:** $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$
- Example: $(x - 3)(x + 3) = x^2 - 9$

## ✏️ Achieve — Detail (20 minutes)

{{% notice style="achieve" title="Exercise 3A — Cambridge Methods Year 11" %}}
Students work at their own pace through the three levels:

| Level | Focus |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Building | Single brackets and collecting like terms |
| 🟡 Extending | Binomial products (FOIL) |
| 🔴 Challenging | Perfect squares and difference of two squares |
{{% /notice %}}

Targeted questioning while circulating:
- *"What happens to the sign when you expand a negative bracket?"*
- *"Which terms are like terms after you expand?"*
- *"Can you spot a shortcut — is this a perfect square or a difference of two squares?"*

| | |
|---|---|
| **Support** | FOIL grid template for We Do and exercises |
| **Extension** | Q7–8 (perfect squares and difference of two squares with surds) |

## 🪞 Reflect — Detail (5 minutes)

{{% notice style="reflect" title="🪞 Exit Ticket" %}}
Students answer on a slip of paper before leaving:

1. Expand and simplify $(2x - 3)(x + 5)$
2. One thing I understood well today was...
3. One thing I am still unsure about is...

*(Answer: $2x^2 + 7x - 15$)*
{{% /notice %}}

**Teacher action:** Review exit tickets before next lesson to identify students who need additional support with sign errors or collecting like terms.

{{% notice style="warning" title="⚠️ Teacher Notes" %}}
| | |
|---|---|
| **Misconceptions** | Sign errors with negative factors: $-3(x+5) = -3x-15$ not $-3x+15$; treating unlike terms as like terms (e.g. adding $3x^2$ and $3x$); missing Outer or Inner in FOIL; thinking $(x+3)^2 = x^2+9$ |
| **Timing** | If Discover runs long, trim Special Expansions to a quick mention. Exit ticket is essential — reduce to Q1 only if pressed |
| **Next lesson** | 3B — Factorising (the reverse process of today's work) |
