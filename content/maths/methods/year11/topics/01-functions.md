## What is a Function?

A function maps each input to exactly one output. 
We write this as $f(x)$.

## Linear Functions

A linear function has the form:

$$f(x) = mx + c$$

Where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the y-intercept.

## Quadratic Functions

A quadratic function has the form:

$$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$

The quadratic formula gives us the roots:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Practice Questions

1. Find the gradient of $f(x) = 3x + 5$
2. Solve $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$ using the quadratic formula
3. Sketch the graph of $f(x) = x^2 - 4$
