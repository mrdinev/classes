 | Learning Intentions  |
 | :-- |
 |  • To understand how an array is used to list the sample space for experiments with two steps <br>• To understand the difference between experiments that are carried out with replacement and without replacement<br>• To be able to use an array to find the sample space for experiments carried out with replacement or without replacement and determine the probability of associated events 
 

| Success Criteria |
| :--------------------- |
|I can list a sample space for experiments with two steps. <br> I can differentiate between experiments with and without replacement. <br> I can find the sample space for experiments with and without replacement.
