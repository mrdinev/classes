    "content": "Lesson Overview Subject Year 11 Mathematical Methods Topic Quadratic Functions Duration 60 minutes Framework VTLM 2.0 / Heathmont Model Learning Intentions By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\nIdentify the key features of a quadratic function including vertex, axis of symmetry, and x-intercepts Sketch the graph of a quadratic function in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ Interpret the effect of changing parameters $a$, $b$, and $c$ on the shape and position of the parabola Success Criteria Students can demonstrate success by:\nCorrectly identifying the vertex and axis of symmetry from a quadratic equation Accurately sketching at least two quadratic functions with correct key features labelled Explaining in their own words how the value of $a$ affects the parabola Curriculum Links Victorian Curriculum Mathematics 2.0 — Algebra and Functions:\nAnalyse the relationship between the graph of $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ and its key features Lesson Structure 🌉 Bridge (10 minutes) VTLM 2.0: Enabling Learning — activating prior knowledge\nPurpose: Connect new content to students’ existing knowledge of linear functions and basic algebra.\nActivity: Think-Pair-Share\nDisplay on board:\n“What do you already know about parabolas? Where have you seen them in real life?”\n2 minutes individual thinking 2 minutes pair discussion 4 minutes class share — record responses on board Teacher connects responses to today’s learning intention Check for understanding: Ask students to sketch a rough parabola shape on their mini whiteboards. Look for common misconceptions about orientation and symmetry.\nResources needed: Mini whiteboards, markers\n🔍 Discover (15 minutes) VTLM 2.0: Explicit Teaching — I do, We do\nPurpose: Direct instruction on key features of quadratic functions with worked examples.\nSequence:\nI Do (8 min) — Teacher models on board:\nIntroduce $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ and name each parameter Work through Example 1: sketch $f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3$ Find y-intercept: let $x = 0$, so $y = 3$ Find x-intercepts: solve $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$, giving $x = 1$ and $x = 3$ Find vertex: axis of symmetry $x = \\frac{-(−4)}{2(1)} = 2$, vertex at $(2, -1)$ Sketch with all features labelled We Do (7 min) — Students work alongside teacher:\nTeacher works Example 2: $f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 8$ on board Students complete same steps in their books simultaneously Pause and check after each step Key vocabulary to emphasise: parabola, vertex, axis of symmetry, x-intercept, y-intercept, concave up/down\nGeogebra embed: Interactive parabola explorer\n✏️ Achieve (25 minutes) VTLM 2.0: Supported Application — guided then independent practice\nPurpose: Students apply learning with decreasing levels of support.\nGuided Practice (10 min):\nStudents work in pairs on Questions 1–3 of the worksheet. Teacher circulates, targeting common errors:\nSign errors when finding the axis of symmetry Forgetting to check concavity (sign of $a$) Incomplete labelling on sketches Independent Practice (15 min):\nStudents work individually on Questions 4–6 of the worksheet.\nTeacher circulates and uses targeted questioning:\n“How do you know which way the parabola opens?” “What does the y-intercept tell you before you do any calculation?” “Can you check your x-intercepts are correct by substituting back in?” Differentiation:\nSupport: Provide partially completed worked example scaffold Extension: Questions 7–8 — transformations of $f(x) = x^2$, introducing vertex form 🪞 Reflect (10 minutes) VTLM 2.0: Enabling Learning — consolidating and metacognition\nExit Ticket (5 min):\nStudents answer on a slip of paper before leaving:\nState the axis of symmetry of $f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 1$ One thing I understood well today was… One thing I am still unsure about is… Class discussion (5 min):\nReturn to learning intentions — thumbs up/sideways/down check Preview next lesson: solving quadratics using the quadratic formula Teacher action: Review exit tickets before next lesson to identify students needing additional support.\nResources Resource Format Link Student Worksheet PDF Download Lesson Slides PDF Download Lesson Plan PDF Download Geogebra Parabola Explorer Web Open Khan Academy — Quadratics Video Watch Teacher Notes Common misconceptions to address:\nStudents often confuse the axis of symmetry formula — emphasise it comes from $x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$, not $\\frac{b}{2a}$ When $a \u003c 0$, students may still draw a concave up parabola out of habit Students sometimes find x-intercepts and stop, forgetting the vertex Timing notes:\nIf the Bridge runs long, trim guided practice to 7 minutes Exit tickets are essential — do not skip even if time is short, reduce to just Question 1 Next lesson: Quadratic formula and the discriminant",
